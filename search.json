    "text": "The purpose of this post is to show how to arrive at the Euler’s totient function (commonly denoted as \\(\\varphi(x)\\)), which provides a convenient way of counting the number of integers less than \\(x\\) that are co-primes with \\(x\\). A discussion on the computational aspect of this function, and possible extensions for investigation will also be provided at the end."

First among these are the resources in the sidebar. (Some of them even serve as inspiration for the format and content of this blog.)\nI’m not sure if I will have the committment to grow this site, but I hope to at least try. It seems that I’ll have to take some big steps along the way. Anyway, the first step is always a big step.\n[Update 2024-01-04] Commenting/annotating is now available through Hypothes.is. Just highlight the passage and sign-up to record the comment."
